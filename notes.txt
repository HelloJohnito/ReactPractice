React is a javascript library for creating UL components
React is the V in MVC
React takes in JSON data and renders it to the user, making it a single page application

Think of everything in Components
  - components are classes that inherit from React.Component
  - components are reusable

Props - attributes that are passed down from the parent component
State - attributes that the user can interact with
  - Update in both will cause a re-render

Render - Uses JSX, looks like HTML.
       - Can Append listeners directly into the HTML tags. Ex. onClick, onChange
       - All components must have a render function

Life Cycle - a function that runs during a certain time of the life cycle of the component
 - ComponentWillMount
 - ComponentDidMount
 - ComponentWillRecieveProps
 - ComponentWillUpdate
 - ComponentDidUpdate
 - ComponentUnmount

Virtual DOM
 - Every time there is an update, React will create a Virtual DOM and compare the changes between the new and the old virtual DOM and make the necessary changes to the DOM
 - Reconciliation Phase: when the virtual DOMs are comparing
 - Diffing Algorithm: uses BFS and when a node has an update, it will re render all its subtrees.
    - Improves the time complexity from o(n^3) to o(n)
